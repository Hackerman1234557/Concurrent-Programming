# Concurrent-Programming
Coursework assignment for my Full Stack Application Development module in the first year of my Computer Science degree.
For this assignment I was required to develop an application that would allow me to consult a database for vinyl records.
The application features a GUI made using Java FX that allows the user to enter their query; namely, how many records there are produced by a given artist in a given city.
Then the server is queried, and will attend to the client request by creating a service loop
The grade achieved for this project was 85%
